This project is a very low cost (under 300 USD components cost) Ground Penetrating Radar. The acquired data can be visualized onboard, in real time, as well as stored and transferred to a PC for further processing.
The digital section uses an Arduino Mega 2560 board.
The onboard visualization uses an LCD shield for Arduino Mega 2560 (LCD TFT 3.2 inch 480 x 320 Pixels + slot sd card, using HX8357 chip).
The analog section is custom built.
The frequency range is 323 MHz - 910 MHz.
